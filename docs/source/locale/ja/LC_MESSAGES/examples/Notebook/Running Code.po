"First and foremost, the Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment "
"for writing and running code. The notebook is capable of running code in "
"a wide range of languages. However, each notebook is associated with a "
"single kernel. This notebook is associated with the IPython kernel, "
"therefor runs Python code."
