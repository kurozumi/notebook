"It is a common problem that people want to import code from Jupyter "
"Notebooks. This is made difficult by the fact that Notebooks are not "
"plain Python files, and thus cannot be imported by the regular Python "
"machinery."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:18
msgid ""
"Fortunately, Python provides some fairly sophisticated `hooks "
"<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/>`__ into the import machinery,"
" so we can actually make Jupyter notebooks importable without much "
"difficulty, and only using public APIs."

msgid "Import hooks typically take the form of two objects:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:46
msgid ""
"a Module **Loader**, which takes a module name (e.g. "
"``'IPython.display'``), and returns a Module"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:48
msgid ""
"a Module **Finder**, which figures out whether a module might exist, and "
"tells Python what **Loader** to use"

"Here we have our Notebook Loader. It’s actually quite simple - once we "
"figure out the filename of the module, all it does is:"

"Since IPython cells can have extended syntax, the IPython transform is "
"applied to turn each of these cells into their pure-Python counterparts "
"before executing them. If all of your notebook cells are pure-Python, "
"this step is unnecessary."

msgid "The Module Finder"

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:162
msgid ""
"The finder is a simple object that tells you whether a name can be "
"imported, and returns the appropriate loader. All this one does is check,"
" when you do:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:170
msgid ""
"it checks whether ``mynotebook.ipynb`` exists. If a notebook is found, "
"then it returns a NotebookLoader."

msgid "Any extra logic is just for resolving paths within packages."

msgid "Register the hook"

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:213

msgid "Let’s look at what we have in the CWD:"

"Here is some simple code to display the contents of a notebook with "

"We also have a notebook inside the ``nb`` package, so let’s make sure "
"that works as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:385
msgid ""
"Note that the ``__init__.py`` is necessary for ``nb`` to be considered a "
"package, just like usual."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Importing Notebooks.ipynb:408
msgid ""
"So now we have importable notebooks, from both the local directory and "
"inside packages."

msgid ""
"I can even put a notebook inside IPython, to further demonstrate that "
"this is working properly:"
