"When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a "

"The first idea of mouse based navigation is that **cells can be selected "
"by clicking on them.** The currently selected cell gets a grey or green "
"border depending on whether the notebook is in edit or command mode. If "
"you click inside a cell’s editor area, you will enter edit mode. If you "

msgid ""
"The second idea of mouse based navigation is that **cell actions usually "
"apply to the currently selected cell**. Thus if you want to run the code "
"in a cell, you would select it and click the button in the toolbar or the"
" “Cell:Run” menu item. Similarly, to copy a cell you would select it and "
"click the button in the toolbar or the “Edit:Copy” menu item. With this "
"simple pattern, you should be able to do most everything you need with "
"the mouse."

msgid ""
"The modal user interface of the Jupyter Notebook has been optimized for "
"efficient keyboard usage. This is made possible by having two different "
"sets of keyboard shortcuts: one set that is active in edit mode and "
"another in command mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Notebook Basics.ipynb:320
msgid ""
"The most important keyboard shortcuts are ``Enter``, which enters edit "
"mode, and ``Esc``, which enters command mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/Notebook/Notebook Basics.ipynb:323
msgid ""
"In edit mode, most of the keyboard is dedicated to typing into the cell’s"
" editor. Thus, in edit mode there are relatively few shortcuts. In "
"command mode, the entire keyboard is available for shortcuts, so there "
"are many more. The ``Help``->``Keyboard Shortcuts`` dialog lists the "
