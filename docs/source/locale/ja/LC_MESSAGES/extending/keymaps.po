"The notebook shortcuts that are defined by jupyter both in edit mode an "
"command mode are configurable in the frontend configuration file "
"``~/.jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.json``. The modification of Keyboard "
"shortcut suffer of several limitations, mainly that your Browser and OS "
"might prevent certain shortcut to work correctly. If this is the case, "
"there are unfortunately not much than can be done. The second issue can "
"arise with keyboard that have a layout different than US English. Again "
"even if we are aware of the issue, there is not much we can do about "
"that."
